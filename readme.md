# ja13

This one directory above the webroot of my website.

In this location, we have the virtual host folders.

A virtual host allows different subdomains or even different domains or IP addresses to behave in different ways.

## common

Common files, to make it easier to configure specific files that are the same across all domains

## http

This is the main website virtual host, http://ja13.org

### lua

This is a folder with some lua scripts that are useful in the OpenComputers mod for Minecraft

### Resources

Some handy files such as dotfiles and scripts which are rather useful

### Presentations

Some presentations I have written for CS classes as well as for the fun of it

## resume

This is where my most up to date resume is stored (and the original copy)

Be prepared for some strange formatting in the original copy.

The PDF looks the same on most devices I've tried.
