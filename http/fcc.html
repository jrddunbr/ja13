    <h3>Groundwork</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      Before I start, please <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf">read the bill here</a>. I'm not perfect, and I may have made a mistake.
    </p>
    <h3>Why I oppose the new FCC Bill</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      I occasionally have some things to say about politics. Most of the time, I ignore what is going on because I have other things in my life worth worrying about, and the news is mostly useless clutter. In this case however, I feel it worthy to be involved and to represent my discontent with this bill.
    </p>
    <h3>What the bill does</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      The new bill overturns some older bills that were put in place during the Obama administration. Most of what it does is changes how the internet is regulated. The technicalities in the laws are quite odd, and I'm not even going to try and explain how that, as well as pole law, can make life sad for consumers who want equal choice in their ISP. What really matters is what the ISP's are allowed to do under the new bill.
    </p>
    <h3>How the bill can affect you</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      The new bill enables ISP's to have a lot more control over how their networks are used. Currently, it is illegal for a company to slow down services to specific locations on the web (ie, you have equal potential bandwidth to Google and Facebook and Amazon, within reason of your physical connection to them), which also implies that there are to be no pay walls. The new bill removes these rules and permits them to do some other interesting things. Effectively, they can make pay walls for whatever services they want you to pay extra for, and can also explicitly block certain traffic, if they feel that way. It's not unusual for ISP's to also do this without saying anything, and often they get caught.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Furthermore, those of you who say they won't be affected because they can just use a VPN are wrong - your ISP would be able to throttle your VPN, or even disable it an require it as a VPN package, for the low price of $9.99 per month. Sounds like cable right? The big difference is that this can negatively affect small and medium size businesses, since they could also regulate what sorts of businesses you would be able to see, or how fast their pages load. It still could take place on a larger level though - want an Amazon package, Google Package, YouTube package, Netflix package, and Facebook package? They could be yours for just 10$ each, per month!
    </p>
    <h3>How ISP's could get away with this evil</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      Interesting to note is the tools that ISP's can use to reduce the speed of your traffic, or just completely eliminate it. I can think of two logical ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Peering - where your ISP connects with other ISP's or service providers - they can add or remove needed data highways to certain services. Comcast and Netflix had a dispute once, and this is the level it took place at</li>
      <li>At the local level - a piece of software in your modem or cable box will slow the connection. It may not even be hardware you own or have access to, but on the pole outside. At this location, it's more likely the traffic can be completely dropped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Further Notes</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      These are just a few different things to better inform one of what there is out there, but I would suggest doing your own research, and learn the facts of why this is so bad for consumers. I'm not infallible, I could have made a mistake somewhwere. But, this is what my understanding is.
