    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      These various rules apply within the LL Discord Server, and also to the Minecraft Servers hosted at (*.)ja13.org.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      This document is intended to help you along by setting some guidelines. If there's ever concern or ambiguity, it's best to contact Jared D. (the owner). Contact information is located at the bottom of this document.
    </p>
    <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      Most of this is common sense guidelines for social interactions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't be rude or annoying to other people (this includes unwelcome pings)</li>
      <li>Do not encourage illegal or unethical activites on the server or elsewhere</li>
      <li>Listen to the requests of the administrators</li>
      <li>YouTubers and other streamers are allowed to stream/record the server, so long as they notify players online at the time before they begin the stream/recording. (an @here is sufficient, for example, <span class="code" style="background: #FBF">Hey @here, just an FYI that I'm about to start a YouTube stream at XYZ channel.</span>)</li>
      <li>Server advertising isn't prohibited, however advertising cracked or illegal servers will get an instaban.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Minecraft-specific Guidelines</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      This section is a bit more specific. This section regards playing on the Minecraft server.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't ask for OP priveleges (to inqure about potential open staff positions, contact us below)</li>
      <li>Do not modify other's builds without prior permission</li>
      <li>Don't use cracked clients, we WILL find out - <b>instaban</b></li>
      <li>Don't claim you're going to "hack the server"</li>
      <li>Client side mods ARE allowed - things like Optifine, Journeymap (including cave mode), mouse tweaks, etc. The packs only include the essential mods required for connecting to the servers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Contact Information</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      The best way to contact Jared is by emailing
      <a href="mailto:ll@ja13.org">ll@ja13.org</a>
      for the LL minecraft server and Discord. Your email's contents may be shared with other server administrators and moderators for the LL server as we see fit.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      PGP key fingerprints (for sending signed/encrpted mail) are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="code">CF20 2CC8 59BA C692</span> (<a target="_blank" href="https://ja13.org/jrddunbr.asc">key</a>)</li>
      <li><span class="code">B7A0 EFF8 3FF7 1E97</span> (<a target="_blank" href="https://ja13.org/jrddunbr2.asc">key</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="indent">
      One of them is an RSA key, the other an ed25519 key. Some programs can only use the RSA key, but the ed25519 key is more secure.
