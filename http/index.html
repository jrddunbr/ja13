        <h2>Hi, my name is Jared.</h2>
        <p>
            This site is always a work in progress. Glad you're visiting.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might find something cool here.

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a computer science sophmore at
            <a href="http://clarkson.edu">Clarkson University</a> (graduating 2019) who loves
            computer science, computer networking, computer engineering,
            computer hardware, embedded design, electronics and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I run this (complicated) website along with many
            different virtual machines for many tasks. It's defintely a learning
            experience, and you can get an idea of what I have done by visiting
            <a href="http://docs.ja13.tk">the docs</a>, or you can consult my
            <a href="http://resume.ja13.tk">resume</a> to see my skills. I also
            have a <a href="https://github.com/jrddunbr/">GitHub account</a>
            if this is not enough for you.
        </p>
        <h3>Contact</h3>
        <p>
            I can be contacted at either
            <a href="mailto:jrddunbr@gmail.com">jrddunbr@gmail.com</a>
            or at <a href="mailto:dunbarj@clarkson.edu">dunbarj@clarkson.edu</a>
            but I would prefer you contact me at my Gmail address.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, I can digitally verify my identity with my PGP key,
            which is on public keysevers, as well as
            <a href="http://pgp.ja13.tk">on this site</a>. It's connected to my
            Gmail address <b>only</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Services</h3>
        <p>
            There are a few services provided by this site. Mostly, these take
            shape in VM images that are run on a VM host that allows them to be
            contained within themselves, to prevent severity of brute ssh
            attacks, as well as just providing a modular system which I can use
            to quickly enable or disable a service without disrupting other
            servies, as well as debugging a service on a laptop instead of the
            VM host without needing to actually have it on the server itself.
            This is helpful for fine grained calibration and configuration.
