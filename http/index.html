    <h2>Hi, my name is Jared<!-- A. Dunbar -->.</h2>

      Welcome to my little nook of the internet.

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      I'm a junior Computer Science B.S. at
      <a href="http://internal.clarkson.edu">Clarkson University</a>,
      graduating in the spring of 2019.</p>
    <p class="indent">
      In my spare time, I work on open source projects. I've worked on an
      Infiniband-based PBX cluster for solving molecular equations, working with
      A/V hardware to set up a hockey stream in the Clarkson University TV
      studio, and other projects that peak my interest. I also help a lot with
      people's hardare and software problems where I can.

      Go to <a href="https://github.com/jrddunbr/">GitHub/jrddunbr</a> to see my open source projects.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      I also work part-time at the Clarkson University Downtown Campus in Old
      Main, where I am currently working at the colocation facility, run by the
      IT department. Some daily tasks include setting up sensor arrays, ground
      cables, and running fiber optic cables through conduits.
