    <h2>Hi, my name is Jared<!-- A. Dunbar -->.</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      Welcome to my little nook of the internet.
      <!-- Please enjoy your stay :) -->
    </p>

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      I'm a junior Computer Science B.S. at
      <a href="http://internal.clarkson.edu">Clarkson University</a>,
      graduating in the spring of 2019.</p>
    <p class="indent">
      In my spare time, I work on open source projects. I'm one of two system
      administrators and active member of the
      <a href="htpp://cosi.clarkson.edu">Clarkson Open Source Institute</a>
      (COSI). I also work with other people on campus with their projects,
      including an Infiniband-based PBX cluster for solving molecular equations,
      working with A/V hardware to set up a temporary stream for national
      television in the Clarkson University TV studio, and other projects that
      peak my interest. I also help a lot with people's hardare and software
      problems.
    </p>

      Go to <a href="https://github.com/jrddunbr/">GitHub/jrddunbr</a> to see my open source projects.
      <!-- Also, the COSI GitLab is a thing: https://gitlab.cosi.clarkson.edu -->
      <!-- Please note, I'm not the best web developer -->
      <!-- I work with Python mostly, but am also well experienced in Java, and
            of all things, LabVIEW. I can also use Inventor with moderate skill -->
      <!-- I am rather experienced in IT stuff, servers, hardware, networking,
            and some backends such as Flask, LAMP, etc. -->
      <!-- I use Arch Linux as my daily operating system, but am experienced
            day-to-day with Ubuntu, Debian, and have worked with openSuSE, CENT, etc -->
      <!-- By the way, -->
      <!-- Stop reading this, and start reading my resume:
                  http://resume.ja13.org/resume.pdf -->
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      I also work part-time at the Clarkson University IT Helpdesk, where I
      do all sorts of things. Some daily tasks include assisting walk-ins with
      hardware and software problems, installing software, fixing hardware,
      as well as problem solving on complicated hardware systems, such as
      microscopes, LabVIEW devices, and other external hardware interfaces that
      you may find at an engineering school.
