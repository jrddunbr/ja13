    <h2>Hi, my name is Jared<!-- A. Dunbar -->.</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      Welcome to my little nook of the internet.
      <!-- Please enjoy your stay :) -->
    </p>

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      I'm a Computer Science B.S. at
      <a href="https://clarkson.edu">Clarkson University</a><!-- http://clarkson.cosi.clarkson.edu -->,
      graduating in the spring of 2019.</p>
    <p class="indent">
      In my spare time, I work on open source projects. I have been an active member of the Clarkson Open Source Institute (COSI) since September 2015, where I have been a system administrator since Spring 2016. I also work on other projects that peak my interest. I also help a lot with people's hardare and software problems where I can.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Go to <a href="https://github.com/jrddunbr/">GitHub/jrddunbr</a> to see my open source projects. You can also visit <a href="https://git.cosi.clarkson.edu/jared">the COSI Git server</a> to see other projects and configurations that are specific to COSI.

    <h3>Recent Work Experience</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      I work part-time at the Clarkson University IT department. Some tasks include setting up sensor arrays, ground cables, and running fiber optic cables through conduits. I also work with installing server hardware, installing Junuper switches and writing configurations, improving documentation, and implementing various in-house monitoring solutions to suppliment the existing systems. In addition, I have also written deployment scripts for a piece of complicated software that requires compiling many libraries from source code, from downloading, compiling, and running unit tests.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      In addition, I have been working on an Infiniband-based SLURM cluster for solving molecular equations in a different department at the University.
