    <h2>Hi, my name is Jared.</h2>
    <p>
      This site is always a work in progress. Glad you're visiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might find something cool here.

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a computer science sophmore at
      <a href="http://clarkson.edu">Clarkson University</a> (graduating 2019)
      who loves computer science, computer networking, computer engineering,
      computer hardware, embedded design, electronics and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time, I run this (complicated) website along with many
      different virtual machines for many tasks. It's defintely a learning
      experience, and you can get an idea of what I have done by visiting
      <a href="http://docs.ja13.org">the docs</a>, or you can consult my
      <a href="http://resume.ja13.org">resume</a> to see my skills. I also
      have a <a href="https://github.com/jrddunbr/">GitHub account</a>
      if this is not enough for you.
    </p>
    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>
      I can be contacted at either
      <a href="mailto:jrddunbr@gmail.com">jrddunbr@gmail.com</a>
      or at <a href="mailto:dunbarj@clarkson.edu">dunbarj@clarkson.edu</a>
      but I would prefer you contact me at my Gmail address.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I can digitally verify my identity with my PGP key,
      which is on public keysevers, as well as
      <a href="http://pgp.ja13.org">on this site</a>. It's connected to my
      Gmail address <b>only</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Services</h3>
    <p>
      There are a few services provided by this site. These services are
      for the most part on virutal machines for isolation. These virtual
      machines run Arch Linux, with two exceptions being the two "MediaWikis".
    </p><p>
      Services include the web server (not to mention a reverse proxy as well),
      an instance of "management2" (check out GitHub), two Minecraft servers,
      my resume and my pgp keys (so that people may gather them as they please),
      and finally, two wikis, one for the public Minecraft server and the other
      which documents how I installed all of the virtual machines, how they are
      configured, and how to recreate them or to make new virtual machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      I highly recommend going to the docs and reading about how I set this
      website up, particularly if you are a person who likes technical computer
      stuff. (not to mention that I set it all up in the proximity of two days)
    </p>
    <h3>Why a .org?</h3>
    <p>
      You may be wondering, why ja13.org?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few reasons behind this. The main reason why I got a .org
      (originally .tk because I have basically no money) is because I treat
      'ja13' as an organization due to my software development, and not as a
      software company. This is mostly because I produce free open source
      software, and most of my 'software' I release under permissive licensing.
