      Welcome to my little nook of the internet.

    <br/>
    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      I'm a Computer Science B.S. junior at
      <a href="http://internal.clarkson.edu">Clarkson University</a><!-- screw clarkson.edu, that website is a marketing powered dumpster fire; useful to almost nobody at the university -->, graduating in the spring of 2019.</p>
    <p class="indent">
     In my spare time, I work on open source projects. I'm one of two system administrators
     and active member of the <a href="htpp://cosi.clarkson.edu">Clarkson Open Source Institute</a> (COSI). Go to my
     <a href="https://github.com/jrddunbr/">GitHub</a> if you're
      looking for many of my open source projects.
      <!-- Also, the COSI GitLab is a thing: https://gitlab.cosi.clarkson.edu -->
      <!-- Please note, I'm not the best web developer -->
      <!-- I work with Python mostly, but am also well experienced in Java, and
            of all things, LabVIEW. I can also use Inventor with moderate skill -->
      <!-- I am rather experienced in IT stuff, servers, hardware, networking,
            and some backends such as Flask, LAMP, etc. -->
      <!-- I use Arch Linux as my daily operating system, but am experienced
            day-to-day with Ubuntu, Debian, and have touched openSuSE, CENT, etc -->
      <!-- I am very familiar with many industry standard security practices,
            and can be known to actually compile security updates into my system -->
      <!-- By the way, -->
      <!-- Stop reading this, and start reading my resume:

          acces a year after I have graduated because they do that... -->

    </div><!-- There's plenty of ways that the FCC is about to screw over consumers. And don't try and tell me that you'll use a VPN or other tool to get around it because they can block that. They (ISP's) will be able to manipulate your inbound and outbound data /however/ they would like. Effectively, our governmnet feels that a /privatized/ version of the "Great Firewall" is a great idea :P, except instead this time it's a paywall... I really disapprove with our (the USA's) government sometimes. -->
