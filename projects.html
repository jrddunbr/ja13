    <h3>Here is a list of my recent major projects!</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ll.ja13.org">LL.ja13.org</a>: The Lusty Lavender Electrical Age Development Server
        <br/>
        This is a development test server I run for the Electrical Age Minecraft mod, which has an electrical circuit simulator, and a great team of developers. Code for the server can be found on my GitHub above, but includes the Electrical Age, and ll.ja13.org repositories.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://eln2.org">eln2.org</a> - Electrical Age 2.0
	<br/>
	Eln2 is a complete ground-up rewrite of Electrical Age, with a brand new Modified Nodal Analysis engine and plans to support Minecraft 1.12 and newer. On the website, you can also find links to the organization on GitHub as well as the most recent progress on the code. It's slow work, but it will be out someday.

        More to be added soon :) Stay tuned!
