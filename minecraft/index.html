    <p>
      We have a whitelist, because otherwise things get destroyed. I make rather infrequent backups, and so most of the time I cross my fingers nothing bad has happened. If you would like to join, please email <a href="mailto:apply@ja13.org">apply@ja13.org</a> so that I may consider you. If you have also been accidentally removed from the whitelist, or if the whitelist is misbehaving, please contact me with the above email as well. Often, it fails closed.

    <h3 id="map_information">Map Information</h3>
    <p>
      The current map is a mix of some new 1.10 terrain plus on the east side of the map, we have stiched in the older 1.7.4 map. By default, you spawn in at the new spawnpoint in the newer part of the map, but by running the
    </p>
    <pre>/warp oldspawn</pre>
    <p>
     command, you can go back to the older map spawn. There is also a large Tardis system, where small blue police boxes show the way. Many of the links are a bit broken however, so beware.
    </p>
    <h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>
    <p>
      Transportation is acieved through many footpaths, rail systems, warps, and the Tardis (which often uses the warps). There is one massive footpath around the entire 1.7.4 map, many kilometers of rail lines that link the old and new maps together, and two tardis's which are linked togeter. The rail systems are best navigated by getting on the track at a station on the right hand side, and the pushing forward. There are a few techniques to navigating some of the stations, but the signage is rather decent and consistent, feel free to ask how to best navigate the system. There are also "european fixers" in many places, which put you on the right side of the track if you accidentally launch from the left.
    </p>
    <h3 id="chat">Chat Rooms</h3>
    <p>
      Often, we use either Discord or Mumble. Both of these applications work on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android), and are relatively easy to get going with. No, we are not using Skype/Hangouts/Teamspeak/etc since they are rather heavy or a pain to set up, but if you want to talk on other channels with other friends, we don't mind as long as there's no crosstalk into official channels. Try Discord before Mumble.

    <h2 id="Operators">Server Operators</h2>
    <p>
      Currently there are a handful of operators. Please don't pester us to become op, we don't take kindly to that. We are defintely good friends though, and ready to help you with anything you need. Don't worry, we don't bite, and we're all friendly.

    <h3>Jared (jrddunbr)</h3>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm the one writing this page, and I am the server administrator. I own the server, and maintain this website, the minecraft server, and run updates to the minecraft server periodically. I've also built a bunch of the rail networks, stiched the maps together, and build a handful of structures with Raven.
    </p>
    <h3>Nathan (Eonaut)</h3>
    <p>
      Builds many massive buildings (such as Grey, Mansion, and other large structures) and has also built the Tardis by himself. Some buildings are very windy and mazelike. Traditionally, is the person who crashes the server the most.
    </p>
    <h3>Raven (Vulonkiin)<!-- Formerly Corbin --></h3>
    <p>
      Has worked with Jared to administrate the server, handling bans, building large castles and epic structures. Good at building older looking structures. Very good at designing buildings and using color/texture palettes.
    </p>
    <h3>Chris (FriendlyGamers)</h3>
    <p>
      Builds many modern buildings, very good at building cool buildings which are well designed.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Old_Worlds">Server Map History</h2>
    <p>
      We have a handful of older maps. There have been over 20 different worlds hosted on the server over 5 different years, but three of the maps have been the longest lived.
    </p>
    <h3 id="1.7.4">1.7.4 Map <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B203VFruA1MxNlVlMHZKZUtpYTQ/view?usp=sharing" target="blank_">(7z)</a></h3>
    <p>
      This map lasted for a very long time, starting in September 2014, and running all the way to early 2016. It was the first map to be used for a very long time on the server, maps before this only being up for about a month to a week at a time. There are many landmarks and the history of the map is rich, especially the map spawn. There were 5 primary maps when the cord was cut:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        main - This map was the spawnpoint, so that if people happened to find the server, they would be away from all of our stuff and not able to grief the main stuff
      </li>
      <li>
        world - This map was the primary map where everything was made. There were warps to the main, mesa, and other maps all in the spawn area.
      </li>
      <li>
        mesa - This map was a late map created in likely late 2015 when my server went down for two weeks due to a broken GRUB, and we used this map in place of the other map.
      </li>
      <li>
        world-nether - This map was a custom parkour map mostly unmodified from when I downloaded it.
      </li>
      <li>
        world-the-end - This map mostly contains Eonaut's big end fortress.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This map was not running for very long (likely from early 2016 to June 16, 2016), but has a handful of builds by jrddunbr and Eonaut. jhndunbr also built mostly in the "Creative area" on the other side of the "creative wall" which was partially a wall, and mostly a row of beacon buildings.

    <p>
      This map was run from June 16, 2016 to early July 2016, this world was created when the server first went public.
    </p>
    <h3 id="current">Current Map</h3>
    <p>
      This map was started in mid 2016, and has been running since. It's a stitched version of the 1.7.4 main world, the Design warp (from 1.7.4's Mesa world), and a brand new 1.10 4k by 4k map, with a few major biomes: Mountain range, field, snow mountains, savanah, rolling hills, and desert mesas.
